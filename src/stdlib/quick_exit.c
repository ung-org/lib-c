The fn(quick_exit) function causes the program to terminate normally, returning

First, all functions registered by fn(at_quick_exit) are called in the reverse
order in which they were registered.

Then, all open streams with unwritten buffered data are flushed. All open
streams are closed. All temporary files created by fn(tmpfile) are removed.
